# Time Value
> Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr, Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you wast one on being angry? *-Niklas Goke*

"Busyness" isn't a badge of honor; it's a sign of weakness.  

> Being busy is a form of mental laziness *-Tim Ferriss*

> The most successful people I know are not busy. They're focused *-Jeff Goins*

For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.

> People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable  *-William Irvine*

What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.

If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.

> The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything. *-Warren Buffet*
