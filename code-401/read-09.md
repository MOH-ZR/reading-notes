# OAuth

It is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.

## advantegaes of OAuth
* This flexible protocol relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure data between the web server and browsers remain private.  
* SSL uses cryptography industry protocols to keep data safe.  
* It uses tokenization to give limited access to the user's data. For example, instead of storing credit card information on Amazon’s web site, the credit card number, security code and consumer name are each given “token” IDs. The tokens are given to the merchant, not the actual data.  
* It is easy to implement and provides strong authentication. In addition to the two-factor authentication, tokens can be revoked if necessary (ie, suspicious activity).  
* Uses single sign on.  

## How OAuth works?

* Step 1 – The User Shows Intent
* Step 2 – The Consumer Gets Permission
* Step 3 – The User Is Redirected to the Service Provider
* Step 4 – The User Gives Permission
* Step 5 – The Consumer Obtains an Access Token
* Step 6 – The Consumer Accesses the Protected Resource
