# CSS GRID  
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but itâ€™s never done a very good job of it.   
These are the main items in GRID layout:
* **Grid container**
* **Grid Item**
* **Grid line**
* **Grid cell**
* **Grid Track**
* **Grid Area**

## Grid Properties

For Grid container:
* display
* grid-template-columns
* grid-template-rows

For Grid items:
* grid-column-start
* grid-column-end
* grid-row-start
* grid-row-end

# Regular Expressions (Regex)  
Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).  

Here are some applications of regex:
* **data validation**
* **data scrabing**
* **data wrangling**
* **string parsing**
* **string replacement**
* **file naming**
* **syntax higlighting**

```js
let regex = /[A-Z]/g // select any character between A and Z
let regex = /Hello/g // select the word hello
```

## Methods of the Regex:
* text()
* match()
* replace()
* split()
