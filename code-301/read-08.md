# SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. 
A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.

```sql
    /*Select all columns of the table*/
    SELECT * FROM mytable;
```
Basic operationson Database:
* CREATE procedures: Performs the INSERT statement to create a new record.
* READ procedures: Reads the table records based on the primary keynoted within the input parameter.
* UPDATE procedures: Executes an UPDATE statement on the table based on the specified primary key for a record within the WHERE clause of the statement.
* DELETE procedures: Deletes a specified row in the WHERE clause.
