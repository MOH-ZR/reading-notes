# EJS Partials
EJS partials, which are used to help us to avoid repetition of the same code on several web pages. For example, you may want the same header for several web pages. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

> Note: The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc..

Because partials are still templates, they have to included in the views folder, in their own sub-directory.
 the following example used an ejs partial-that is included in partials directory- for the footer:
 ```html
 <body>
        <div class="container">
            <%- include('partials/navbar') %>
            <div class="jumbotron">
                <h1>All about Node</h1>
                <p class="lead">Check out our articles below!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <div class="list-group">
                      <!-- loop over blog posts and render them -->
                      LIST_OF_POSTS
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <%- include('partials/footer') %>
        </div>
    </body>
 ```
