# Diversity and Inclusion
## Why diversity matters to your tech company?

* **Diverse teams are smarter and more creative**:

* **Diverse companies perform better**:
a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

* **Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base**
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
