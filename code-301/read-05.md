# Heroku
Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS), delivering tools that enable software development. Heroku, as a PaaS, allows business to quickly deploy, build, manage, and scale enterprise-level applications while bypassing infrastructure headaches normally required to host an enterprise quality application. It acts as the middle-man between hosting/infrastructure and Salesforce.

Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to focus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers, hardware, or infrastructure. The Heroku experience provides services, tools, workflows, and polyglot supportâ€”all designed to enhance developer productivity.
