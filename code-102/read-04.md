# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a programing language used mainly in front-end web development to make your web pages more interactive and dynamic by accessing and modifying web content based for example on some actions. It gives your web page some functionality to react for events.

comparision operators:
* ">": greater than
* "<": less than
* "==": is equal(compare just the value)
* "===": is equal(compare value and type of operands)

variable is like a container for any data you want.

in JS you can declar a variable like this : var x = 5;
when you declare a variable check the following points:
* the name must begin with a letter, $, or _
