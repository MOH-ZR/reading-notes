# Mohammad Za'areer
I'm 29 years old, from Ajloun in the north of Jordan. I graduated 5 years ago from Jordan University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor's degree in **computer engineering**. After graduation I worked as call center agent and then worked in marketing. and now I'm pursuing my passion to be a software developer during the upcoming 6 months at ASAC here in Amman.

In general, I'm interested in information technology especially the hot topics like AI, ML and data Science,  these will change our wolrd to be a better place and sovle complex challenges that can't be solved before. I hope to be an entrepreneur who create and participate in making these technoloies. and this scholarship from ASAC is my first step on this way.
